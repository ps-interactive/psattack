# Brute Force RPC Authentication

A stealthy version of the RPC brute force authentication attack. This attack is similar to the one used by Sandworm Team during the 2016 attack against the Ukraine electric grid. In that campaign, Sandworm Team used known credentials and brute forced the target host using a script. This attack uses a known username and target ip address and brute forces the password.
